<h3>To create the environment</h3>
<br>
  Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:<br>
  Create the environment from the environment.yml file:<br>
    

conda env create -f environment.yml


<br>
    The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name. For details see [Creating an environment file manually](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually).<br><br>
    Activate the new environment:
    <br>
    
    conda activate myenv
    
<br>
    Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:<br>
    
    conda env list
    
<br>
    You can also use 
    
    conda info --envs
